## Introduction
Before diving in, let's throw out a common misconception. ~~Javascript is Java~~. Javascript is actually an entirely different programming language than Java. Javascript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in others.

So what is Javascript? Javascript is a small and lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is generally found in two flavors, `client-side` Javascript and `server-side` Javascript. In these tutorials and challenges, the focus is on `client-side` code. Basic HTML and CSS is covered as well, but emphasis is placed on Javascript.
